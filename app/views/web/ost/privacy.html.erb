        OST Platform is a blockchain-technology based service. OST makes its best efforts to collect as little personal data from its clients and their users as possible. Regarding our clients’ end users, there are only two personal data parameters that are saved on OST Platform:
      </p>
      <p class="ml-2">
        1. The end user email address for redemption options, as explained in the above table.<br/>
        2. The end user’s unique id:
      </p>
      <p class="ml-2">
        The unique id is created on OST Platform to allow our clients to map their own users with the information existing on the clients’ side. The user id is not publicly available and only shared between OST and the client. OST does not know the identity behind the unique id; only the client which this user belongs to can associate this unique id with the user.
      </p>
      <p class="ml-2">
        Being a blockchain-technology based service, transactions executed on the blockchain are public and cannot be deleted. However, in order to comply with the user’s right to be forgotten, we take measures when a user wants his/her personal data to be removed from OST Platform by deleting all blockchain identifiers associated with the user id.
      </p>
      <p class="ml-2">
        OST VIEW is an open source block explorer provided by OST for viewing Brand Token transactions and contracts on the OST sidechains. OST Platform’s clients and their end users should be aware that the transactions signed by them are visible publicly though OST VIEW. Using OST VIEW is only one of the ways to visualize these transactions on the blockchains, as the sidechains can be accessed and read by anyone.
